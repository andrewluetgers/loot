Loot.js

Underscore is cool but for some odd reason it annoys me to do _. for everything and I will never use much of that library so I took some stuff from there and other sources and set up this to store all the little snippets I like to use. $buffer, $make and $speak are from me and I think they work nicely :-) beware, the sauce extension is still under construction but the io module should work fine. Bugs, patches, suggestions etc. welcome.
