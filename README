Underscore is cool but for some odd reason it annoys me to do _. for everything and I will never use much of that library
so I took some stuff from there and other sources and set up this little library to store all the little snippets I like
to use. The $make and $speak are min me and I think they work well together :-) beware the sauce extension is still under construction but the io module should work fine. Bugs, patches, suggestions etc. welcome.
