Esprima ([esprima.org](http://esprima.org)) is an educational
[ECMAScript](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)
(also popularly known as [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript>JavaScript))
parsing infrastructure for multipurpose analysis. It is also written in ECMAScript.

Esprima is created and maintained by [Ariya Hidayat](http://ariya.ofilabs.com/about)
(Twitter: [@ariyahidayat](http://twitter.com/ariyahidayat)), with the help of
[many contributors](https://github.com/ariya/esprima/contributors).

### Features

- Supports [ECMAScript 5.1](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)
with an experimental branch for ES.Next/Harmony
- Sensible format for the abstract syntax tree (AST), compatible with Mozilla
[Parser API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SpiderMonkey/Parser_API)
- Heavily tested (> 500 [unit tests](http://esprima.org/test/) with solid 100% code coverage)
- Optional tracking of syntax node location (index-based and line-column)
- [Blazing fast](http://esprima.org/test/benchmarks.html), up to 2.5x faster than
UglifyJS `parse-js` ([speed comparison](http://esprima.org/test/compare.html))
